# Welcome

Hi, I’m a PhD student in Astrophysics at the University of California, Irvine.  
My research focuses on mitigating stellar activity to improve radial velocity (RV) precision for detecting Earth-mass exoplanets. I apply **Transit Surface Reconstruction (TSR)**, a novel technique in transit spectroscopy, to quantify the RV impact of stellar surface features such as starspots and granulation.

I received my B.S. in Astronomy and Physics with distinction in research from the University of Texas at Austin (2021). My undergraduate research included dynamical mass measurements of young stars using **ALMA** data, as well as identifying an obscured AGN in a high-redshift galaxy, both published as first-author Research Notes. Following graduation, I worked at the **SETI Institute’s Hat Creek Radio Observatory**, where I gained hands-on experience in FRB, pulsar, and technosignature searches.

Currently, I am a member of Dr. Paul Robertson’s research group at UC Irvine, working on high-resolution spectroscopy with instruments such as the **Keck Planet Finder (KPF)** to characterize stellar variability and enable the detection of small, temperate exoplanets.
