# Research

## Graduate Research at UC Irvine

My research interests lie at the intersection of stellar astrophysics and exoplanet detection, particularly in disentangling the effects of stellar activity on radial velocity (RV) measurements.

### Transit Surface Reconstruction (TSR)

Currently, I am a member of Dr. Paul Robertson’s research group at UC Irvine, where I am focused on mitigating the impact of stellar activity on radial velocity (RV) measurements to enable the detection of small, temperate exoplanets. My thesis centers on Transit Surface Reconstruction
(TSR), a technique that isolates the stellar surface occulted during a planetary transit by subtracting in-transit spectra from a master out-of-transit spectrum. This method enables spatially resolved spectroscopy of the stellar surface and allows us to directly detect localized inhomogeneities like starspots—features that introduce RV noise, or “jitter”, and complicate planet detection and characterization. I have developed a pipeline to apply TSR to data from the Keck Planet Finder (KPF), leveraging observations from a successful proposal I led. This work builds upon
prior efforts with HARPS data and incorporates support for newer high-resolution spectrographs.

I am currently applying this pipeline to well-studied systems such as HD 189733 and HD 209458. My analysis includes extracting residual Cross-Correlation Functions (CCFs), tracking their evolution across exposures, and assessing how stellar activity modifies the shape and depth of spectral lines at different locations on the stellar surface. In doing so, I am uncovering how active regions (specifically starspots) imprint themselves on spectral line profiles, with the goal of quantifying their contribution to RV jitter in high-precision exoplanet searches. I plan to expand this work to include other stars with well-documented spot modulation and high-quality transit and RV data—which will test TSR in a system with complex activity signatures and help broaden the sample of stars for which this technique is applicable. By combining insights from photometric variability and time resolved spectroscopy, my goal is to develop a more comprehensive framework for understanding and mitigating stellar activity across a wide range of stellar types. 

## Observing Experience

I also bring hands-on observing experience at Keck and Lick Observatories, which has deepened my understanding of the instruments and observing strategies behind the data I analyze. Being part of the NEID and HPF consortia has further broadened my perspective, offering opportunities to engage with a collaborative community of researchers working at the forefront of RV science. These experiences have not only informed my technical approach but also provided the opportunity to contribute to large, multi-institutional projects focused on advancing exoplanet detection capabilities.

## Previous Research Experience

## Research Assistant at SETI Institute

From 2021-2022, I was a Research Assistant at the SETI Institute’s Hat Creek Radio Observatory. I took this opportunity to gain firsthand experience with full-time research and observational astronomy, and to deepen my expertise in Python before starting my Ph.D. As a research assistant, I conducted observations with the Allen Telescope Array and analyzed potential Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) and candidate technosignature signals—the telltale sign of a technologically capable civilization. I carried out an all-sky survey for narrowband signals while mitigating the effects of radio frequency interference, and compiled observing and data reduction scripts. As the primary operator of the telescope during its pre-commissioning refurbishment phase, I developed technical experience in calibrating antenna pointing and optimizing sensitivity. This hands-on instrumentation work opened my eyes to the complexity of observatory operations and reinforced my commitment to pursuing observational astrophysics. My contributions to SETI projects have resulted in numerous co-authorships, including a publication in Nature Astronomy (Bright et
al. 2023, Nature Astronomy, Volume 7, p. 986–995).

## Undergraduate Research at UT Austin

My first formal research experience was through UT Austin’s Freshman Research Initiative, where I learned scientific programming and independent research by analyzing color-magnitude diagrams of open clusters and later simulating white dwarf atmospheres using plasma codes from laboratory astrophysics. In my second year, I was awarded the John W. Cox Endowment to work with Drs. Brendan Bowler and Ya-Lin Wu on a project using Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data to derive dynamical masses of pre-main sequence stars. I reduced interferometric data and utilized radiative transfer models using CASA and Python pipelines, leading to a presentation at the American Astronomical Society (AAS) and the publication of a Research Note (Premnath et al. 2020a). I later received a second Cox Fellowship to study molecular line excitation in the high-redshift galaxy
WISE J1329+2243 with Drs. Caitlin Casey and Justin Spilker. I reduced submillimeter spectra, and identified a dust-obscured AGN—work presented at the next AAS and published as another Research Note (Premnath et al. 2020b). These experiences built my foundation in data analysis, model fitting, and scientific communication across a range of astrophysical topics.

## Commitment to Mentorship and Equity

In addition to my research, I am deeply committed to education, mentorship, and community building. I have served as a Teaching Assistant for multiple undergraduate physics courses, where I prioritize inclusive pedagogy and student-centered learning. As an active member of the Physics and Astronomy Community Excellence (PACE) program, I mentor first-year graduate students as they navigate the transition into graduate school, and provide individualized support to upper division undergraduates applying to REUs and graduate programs. I also serve as a co-lead of the department’s Aspiring Allyship Group, which I helped organize to foster dialogue around equity and inclusion through facilitated discussions and community reading sessions. Most recently, I began my term as an administrator for the Physics Graduate Caucus at UCI, where I lead efforts to strengthen the graduate student community, support Teaching Assistants, and advocate for meaningful, student-led change within our Department. Through these roles, I have cultivated a commitment to improving the academic climate and promoting equity at all levels of the physics and astronomy community
