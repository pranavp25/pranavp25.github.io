# Welcome

I am a third-year doctoral student in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at UC Irvine. My research focuses on exoplanet detection and stellar variability, using high-resolution spectroscopy and photometry to understand how active stars impact planet detection. My academic journey has spanned multiple subfields, including galaxy evolution, star formation, and radio astronomy, and is rooted in a strong foundation of computational and observational techniques.

Currently, I work with Dr. Paul Robertson on Transit Surface Reconstruction (TSR), a novel method for spatially resolving stellar surfaces during transits.
