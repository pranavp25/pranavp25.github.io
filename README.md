# Welcome

I am a third-year doctoral student in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at UC Irvine. My research focuses on exoplanet detection and stellar variability, using high-resolution spectroscopy and photometry to understand how active stars impact planet detection. My academic journey has spanned multiple subfields, including galaxy evolution, star formation, and radio astronomy, and is rooted in a strong foundation of computational and observational techniques.

Currently, I work with Dr. Paul Robertson on Transit Surface Reconstruction (TSR), a novel method for spatially resolving stellar surfaces during transits. I also contribute to instrumentation and data pipelines through the NEID and HPF spectrograph consortia, and bring hands-on experience from Keck, Lick, and the Allen Telescope Array.

Beyond research, I am dedicated to mentorship, teaching, and equity work within the physics and astronomy community.
