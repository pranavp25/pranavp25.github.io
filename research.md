# Research

## Graduate Research at UC Irvine

My research interests lie at the intersection of stellar astrophysics and exoplanet detection, particularly in disentangling the effects of stellar activity on radial velocity (RV) measurements.

### Transit Surface Reconstruction (TSR)

At UC Irvine, I am developing and applying a technique called **Transit Surface Reconstruction** (TSR), which spatially resolves the stellar surface along a planet’s transit chord. By subtracting in-transit spectra from an out-of-transit master, we isolate local stellar features like starspots and quantify their impact on spectral line shapes and RV measurements.

Projects include:
- Applying TSR to **Keck Planet Finder (KPF)** data
- Residual CCF analysis for systems like **HD 189733** and **HD 209458**
- Extension to complex targets like **HAT-P-11**

## Post-baccalaureate Research at SETI Institute

As a post-bac at the SETI Institute, I worked on:
- **Allen Telescope Array operations**
- **FRB and technosignature detection**
- Development of **observing scripts** and **RFI mitigation**
- Co-authorship on a **Nature Astronomy** paper (Bright et al. 2023)

## Undergraduate Research at UT Austin

- **ALMA-based dynamical mass modeling** of young stars (Bowler & Wu)  
- **Submillimeter AGN detection** with Drs. Casey and Spilker  
- White dwarf atmosphere simulation using plasma codes  
- Early research via UT Austin’s **Freshman Research Initiative**

## Commitment to Mentorship and Equity

In addition to my research, I am deeply committed to education, mentorship, and community building. I have served as a Teaching Assistant for multiple undergraduate physics courses, mentored first-year graduate students, supported undergraduates applying to REUs and graduate programs, and co-led departmental initiatives on equity and inclusion.
